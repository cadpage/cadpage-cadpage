    This is the free version of Cadpage.  This version will never bother you
    for financial contributions to future Cadpage development.  Customer support
    is minimal, and updates will be infrequent at best.\n
    \n
    If you are new Cadpage user, you should start out using the standard
    Cadpage version.  You can run it for at least 30 days for free during
    which you can take advantage of the very efficient customer support service.\n
    \n
    If you are willing to pay to Cadpage developers to continue supporting 
    Cadpage development, you should use the standard version.\n
    \n
    If you cannot afford to pay the $9.99 per year standard payment, you should use the standard
    version and ask for a free subscription.\n
    \n
    If you are adamantly opposed to paying anything on general principle, you
    should still run the standard version for the initial 30 day demo period,
    then switch to this version.
