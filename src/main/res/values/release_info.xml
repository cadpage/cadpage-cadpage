    WARNING!!!\n
    Cadpage notifications are **NOT** working under Android 10, which is currently
    being distributed to Pixel devices.  If you are running on a Pixel, try to avoid
    upgrading to Android 10 until we can get this fixed.  If you have already
    upgraded to Android 10, please switch to the Cadpage beta test track.  We will
    probably release the Android 10 fix as beta release in the next couple days.\n

    v2.1.4-03\n
    Modified to target Android 9.  For most users, upgrading to this release will be
    uneventful.  For reasons that remain mysterious, a handful of users will discover that
    regular Cadpage notifications now require permission to access user data.  Cadpage will
    attempt to identify these users and request user data permission when this update is
    installed in hopes of preventing it from failing when a real alarm is processed.\n
