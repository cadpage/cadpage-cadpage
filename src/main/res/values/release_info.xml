    Cadpage now recommends that you disable battery optimization for Cadpage, which we hope will
    simplify processing and get Cadpage working on two obstinate Samsung devices.  This will not
    actually increase battery consumption.  Future versions of Cadpage will probably require this
    action when you are running on Android 12 or better.\n
