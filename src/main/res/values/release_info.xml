    v2.2.13-01\n
    The Google play version of Cadpage will no longer prompt users to install the support app.
    Users who have already installed that app can continue using it but will be warned that it
    will disappear in some future release.  Without that support app, the Google Play version
    cannot process incoming text messages which has been a core Cadpage functionality.  Users will
    either have to switch to using the Cadpage paging service, which requires a paid subscription,
    or find and install Cadpage from some other source.\n
    \n
    First time Cadpage subscription purchases should now get a free 30 day demo.  Haven\'t been able
    to test that so I hope it works.\n
    \n
    v2.2.12-02\n
    Published through Aptoide store\n
    \n
    v2.2.12-01\n
    A purchased Cadpage subscription is now optional unless you are using the Cadpage paging service.\n
    \n
    More big changes are coming.  See our facebook page for details.\n
