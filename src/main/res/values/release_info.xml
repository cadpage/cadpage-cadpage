    v2.2.08-01\n
    If this version is installed, Google has decided to allow Cadpage to process incoming text
    messages directly.  Which means it is no longer necessary to install the Cadpage support app
    for normal operations.  I will be (was) necessary to grant Cadpage permission to access text messages
    when this version was installed.\n
    \n
    The support app will still be required for users that have configured response buttons
    generate phone calls or text messages to report their response status.  Sorry, but I did not
    want to try and make the case that that feature was essential to Cadpage operation.\n

    The Active911 registration process has been changed so that will now work with the European server.
    If you are using Cadpage with Active911 in Europe, you will need to unregister from Active911,
    the re-register appending "EU" to the end of your old activation code.\n
