    Updated 03/16/2019\n
    \n
    v2.1.4-01\n
    Modified to target Android 9.  For most users, upgrading to this release will be
    uneventful.  For reasons that remain mysterious, a handful of users will discover that
    regular Cadpage notifications now require permission to access user data.  Cadpage will
    attempt to identify these users and request user data permission when this update is
    installed in hopes of preventing it from failing when a real alarm is processed.\n
