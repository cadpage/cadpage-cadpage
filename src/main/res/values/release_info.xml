    The main Cadpage app no longer supports anything before Android 4.0.  This is a variant that
    will continue to be maintained to support users back to Android 2.3.  Updates may be
    infrequent.  And it looks like I will loose the ability to distribute them through
    Google Play Store on November 1.  We will have to wait and see what happens then.\n
