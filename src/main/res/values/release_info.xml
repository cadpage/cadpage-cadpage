    This release fixes a problem with the button configuration settings introduced in the Cadpage
    release published on 8/12/2020.  If you have not changed your button settings since that date,
    this release will fix everything.  But if you have manually fixed the button configuration
    problems introduced with that release, this release may break them again.  In which case you
    will need to fix them again.\n

    Complete rewrite of the settings menu to hopefully make it more logical.\n
    \n
    There is a new "Alert Display Mode" in Call Detail Settings that determines how alert details
    are displayed.  The default "Split Screen" will display call history and call details in a
    split screen in the landscape orientation.  "Popup" is close to the classic Cadpage alert
    display.  "Full Screen" is what the original beta release did.\n
