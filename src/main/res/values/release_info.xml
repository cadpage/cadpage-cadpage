    v2.2.02-05\n
    There is a new "Alert Display Mode" in Call Detail Settings that determines how alert details
    are displayed.  The default "Split Screen" will display call history and call details in a
    split screen in the landscape orientation.  "Popup" is close to the clasic Cadpage alert
    display.  "Full Screen" is what the original beta release did.\n
