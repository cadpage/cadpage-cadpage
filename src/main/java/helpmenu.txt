Welcome to Cadpage!

Cadpage assists emergency first responders in getting dispatched to an emergency scene.

Cadpage only works if you belong to a fire department or other emergency response organization
that is sending alerts to this device when a call is dispatched.  Alerts can be sent as text
messages, or if your department uses CodeMessaging or Active911 as a message service, as direct pages.

* My Department sends me text alerts
* My department uses CodeMessaging
* My department uses Active911
* I am not receiving department dispatch alerts

Text dispatch alerts

Text dispatch alerts

You need to tell Cadpage something about where you are so that it knows how to interpret the alerts
you are receiving.  Usually, this is just a matter of selecting the location where your dispatch
center is located.

* Select the appropriate location
* My current location is not supported
* Location is selected, but Cadpage is still not working

Text dispatch alerts

OK, we are going to have to ask our developer for help with this, and he is going to need to
see some examples of what your text alerts look like.  Choosing to email the developer immediately
after Cadpage fails to pick up an alert is the best way to get this information to him.

* Email the developer
* Done

Active911 alerts

You need to register Cadpage with the Active911 service.  To do this, you will need your Active911 device
activation code which you can get from your departments IT people.

* Register with Active911

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CodeMessaging alerts

You need to register Cadpage with the CodeMessaging service.  The process is pretty much self-explanatory.
The only tricky part is that you have to answer "YES" when you are asked if you
are receiving CodeMessaging alerts.

* Register with CodeMessaging

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cadpage is good to go!

Hopefully, Cadpage will start working properly.  If you still have problems, use the
"Email the Developer" setting to contact the developer for assistance.

* Email the developer

No dispatch alerts

Cadpage will not do anything for you if you are not receiving dispatch alerts.
If you are part of an emergency response organization, talk to your department's IT people and
see if they can send you the department's dispatch alerts.

If you are not part of an emergency response organization, Cadpage will not be useful to you.

If you have any questions or suggestions as to how Cadpage might be more useful, feel free to use
the "Email the Developer" setting to contact us.
